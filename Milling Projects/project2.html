  <h3>About Me</h3>
  
  <p>My name is Danny Milling.  I am a senior economics and English double major at Notre Dame.  Throughout my time at Notre Dame, I have learned many skills both in and out of the classroom.  These skills will help find me success in my future career as the winner of <strong>Survivor</strong>.</p>
  
  <p>Having been a fan of Surivor since season two <em>Austrailian Outback </em>, I believe I can win.  I am personable and friendly, but <strong>I will go behind someone's back if need be.</strong>  Also, I hope that I not only win, but I am also a fan favorite so I can come back for future seasons.<p>
  
  <p>My Favorite quote: <q>Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God.</q>  - Benjamin Franklin </p>
